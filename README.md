I had done  a hard coding in the app by using 
default email Id:john@gmail.com
default password:john2003

There is list of meeting that we can connect ,which I had made by using List Tiles.
On single tap ,we can know the details of the meeting.
On long press of the tile ,we can get the QR code of the meeting which gives the details of the meeting on scnning it.

I had given the QR scanner at the top right corner.

This is designed to connect people with similar intersts.They are a great way to socialize,network,and discover new things in your community.One Interesting aspect of meetups app is the use of algorithms and machine learning to match individuals with events and groups that alighn with their interests,leading to more personalized and relevent recomendations.Additionally,some meetups also have built_in features for organizing events,tracking RSVPs,and faciliating communication between members,making it easier for people to connect and plan activities.
